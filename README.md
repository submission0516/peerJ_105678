# AI in Healthcare: Text Mining and Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository accompanies the research paper titled *"Emerging Trends and Future Directions of AI in Healthcare."* The project applies advanced text mining techniques, clustering algorithms, and deep learning models to analyze a large corpus of scientific papers and patents (2018-2022) related to AI in healthcare. The goal is to identify key technological evolutions, research priorities, and commercialization processes.

### Key Features:
- **Wordcloud**: Visual representation of the most frequent terms in the text corpus.
- **BERTopic**: A topic modeling approach using BERT embeddings to uncover underlying themes in the data.
- **NLP**: Various natural language processing techniques applied to clean and process the dataset.

## Repository Structure

You can find the complete project structure in the following repository:

- **GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/submission0516/peerJ_105678/tree/main](https://github.com/submission0516/peerJ_105678/tree/main)

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used in this analysis (not included in this repository for privacy reasons).
- **code/**
  - `Analysis.ipynb`: Performs data analysis using WordCloud, BERTopic, and other NLP tools.
  - `data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Prepares the raw dataset for analysis by cleaning and formatting the text.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: 
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib wordcloud bertopic transformers
  ```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/submission0516/peerJ_105678.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `code/` directory.
   ```bash
   cd code
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks (`Analysis.ipynb` and `data_preprocessing.ipynb`) step by step.

### Notes:
- The dataset used in this project is not included for privacy reasons.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the notebooks.
